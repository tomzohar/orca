# Vision: Autonomous Software Orchestrator

The goal is to create a platform for orchestrating a team of AI agents that collaborate to build software.
The system uses a Centralized State architecture where agents collaborate on a shared state rather than just chatting.
It features a Human-in-the-Loop Dashboard for monitoring, state editing, and intervention.

The vision is to move beyond simple chat-based assistants to a fully agentic software development lifecycle where AI agents act as robust team members, capable of planning, executing, and reviewing code with human oversight.
